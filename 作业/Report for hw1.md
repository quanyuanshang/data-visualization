## Task1:

The chart compares sweetness, balance, acidity, and flavor intensity (0–10 scale) for coffees from the Philippines and Uganda. Uganda shows higher acidity, sweetness,aroma,balance, afterstate and flavor scores, possibly due to volcanic soil and varietals, while the Philippines has lower scores in every ascepts.

## Task2:

This visualization plots coffee evaluation scores (Aroma, Average Attitude) against altitude (500–2500m). Aroma scores range from ~7.1 to 8.4, while Average Attitude spans ~9.1 to 10.0. Higher altitudes (e.g., 2000–2500m) generally correspond to higher sweetness scores, suggesting altitude may enhance aroma complexity due to slower cherry maturation.
